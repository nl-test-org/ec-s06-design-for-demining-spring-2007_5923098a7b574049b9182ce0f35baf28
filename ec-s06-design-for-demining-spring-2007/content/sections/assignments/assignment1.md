Activity
--------

Write down 5 or more ideas for products or services that address some aspect of the landmine problem.

Represent each idea with a thumbnail sketch and a name on a 3x5 or 4x6 card. Include as much or as little information as you have for each one. Write clearly and boldly and fill the card. Use a ball point pen or black marker to write with.

An idea may be for a whole product that addresses an opportunity fairly completely or for a part of one that meets a sub-opportunity or solves a sub-problem that must be further developed to describe a whole product.

Aim for diversity in your ideas. If you find your ideas are variations on each other then push yourself to think more broadly.

Do not judge or censor ideas at this stage. If you feel the urge to dismiss an idea, use this feeling as a trigger to come up with another idea that contributes something instead of taking something away.
