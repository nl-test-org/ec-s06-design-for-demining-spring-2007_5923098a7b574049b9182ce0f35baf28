Progress
--------

Summarizing the status of your project and progress since the last design review.

Identify any implementation concerns or outstanding issues that you have.

Implementation
--------------

Discuss the implementation choices that you have made and your reasons for making them. Include photos of models and or prototypes. Include specifics such as material choices and dimensions.

Include photos and charts of data if available. For example, if you have acted out with a model or prototype, include a sequence of photos showing the interaction. If you have run experiments, create a table of experiments outlining what was varied and what the outcomes were.

Final Steps
-----------

List the steps that will be taken to complete the project. Focus on completing prototypes, models or experiments that that demonstrate the feasibility of the ideas well.

Presentation
------------

Prepare a 10 minute presentation to be given in class on the due date. There will be time for about 10 minutes of Q&A and discussion after your presentation. Practice this presentation and adjust it to fit the time available.

You may use up to 4 overhead slides and as many props (prototypes, foam models, experimental outcomes, products purchased, etc.) as you have available and time will allow. You are not required to use slides, but will need to create handouts or use some other means to convey some of the information.

Make any materials that you use as visual as possible. Annotate these visuals with titles and labels.
