Technologies
------------

Find 2 examples of each of the following technologies used in demining.

1.  Small tools or devices about the size that would fit in a duffel bag
2.  Medium sizes tools or devices about the size of a kitchen table
3.  Large size tools or devices about the size of a vehicle
4.  Animals or plants of any size

You will need to find out about 8 technologies (2 examples X 4 categories). You should not use more than four technologies from the reading so far in this class including the reading for this assignment. One or two Web sites will give you all of the answers if you find the right ones.

Try to find technologies that do widely different things. You could use the Bob Keeley reading as a guide to areas of demining, which will all have associated technology. Give each technology a name and write a sentence or two on what it is used for and how it works. Obtain an image for each one. Compile these into a document with one technology per page by inserting page breaks after each technology entry.
