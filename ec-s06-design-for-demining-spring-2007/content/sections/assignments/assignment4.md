Assigned: Ses #4  
Due: Ses #5

Note: Assignments 4 and 5 are assigned and due at the same time.

Read at least 10 incident records selected at random in the [Database of Demining Incidents and Victims](http://www.ddasonline.com/). Do not read sequentially.

Focus on exploring these by "Activity" and by "Cause." It is less helpful to explore them by "Country." Also, read the Incident Record "Notes."

Demining incidents are a great way to learn about issues in demining that could potentially be addressed through design. As you read the incidents, come up with one or more ideas for each of the records you read.

Pay attention to the types of people involved as well as the nature of the incident. Think about who your ideas are meant to help. You may find that most of your ideas help only one community member type such as deminers. By changing your focus to other community members, you can usually think of many more ideas.

Represent each idea with a title and thumbnail sketch on a 3x5 or 4x6 card and label the sketch. Write clearly and boldly and create large sketches on the card. Use a bold black marker to write with.
