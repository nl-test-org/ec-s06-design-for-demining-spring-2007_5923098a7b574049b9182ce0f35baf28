### Pictures

The blast tests pictured below were conducted using various weights of 50/50 PETN/TNT sheet to replicate different sorts of landmine. Foam-stuffed rubber gloves were attached to assess potential damage to clipper operators. The clippers were held near the test charge at the maximum acceptable approach angle. Test results were evaluated on the fragmentation of the tool itself and the blast shield's effectiveness at protecting the rubber glove. Images appear courtesy of Andrew Brooks and Marta Luczynska, and are used with permission. The following document contains more details about the blast tests and the aftermath.
